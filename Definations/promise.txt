Promsie: 

A Promise in JavaScript is an object representing the eventual completion or 
failure of an asynchronous operation. A promise can be in one of three states:

Pending: The initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
Fulfilled: The operation completed successfully.
Rejected: The operation failed. 

A promise provides methods to handle the asynchronous operation's result once it has completed. 
The primary methods are .then(), .catch(), and .finally().

Example: 

conse mypromise = new Promise((resolve, reject)=>{
    let success = true
    if(success){
        resolve("operation successfull")
    }else{
        reject("operation fail")
    }
}).then((message)=>{console.log(message)}).catch((error)=>{console.log(error)})


====================================

Promise Changing :it is also called promisfication , it is the process which converting a callback 
based api to promise based api . 
it involves wrapping a function that uses a callBacks into the function that returns a promise.
it is more easier to work with asynchronious code
