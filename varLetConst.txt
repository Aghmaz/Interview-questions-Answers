variables are the containers that can hold the data.

we can store data into three types of variables 
one is var , second is let and rest one is const 

now lets discuss how can we use these variables 

first of all we have var , we can re-initialize and can change its value many time 

but in let case , we can change its value but we cannot use let keyword for the next time 


for const , we cannot change its value 


var has a global scope 
and let and const are the block scope


Example :

var a = 23
var a = 25 
a = 29 

console.log(a)
output : 29 


let  b = 23 
b = 25 
console.log(b)
output : 25

const c = 24
console.log(c)
output : 24
